    The Unet is proposed by:<br>
    O. Ronneberger, P. Fischer, and T. Brox, “U-net: Convolutional networks for biomedical image segmentation,” in International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention. Springer, 2015, pp. 234–241.<br>
    One trained model is saved as 'checkpoint\model_epoch_26.pkl'. The train_kidney.py is the training file, and the mytest.py is the test file. The test file can be runned directly.
